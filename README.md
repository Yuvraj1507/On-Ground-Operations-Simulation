# 🚀 On-Ground Operations Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Node.js-based simulation system** designed to optimize hotel check-ins
and airport transfers by enhancing service flow and reducing wait times. The system employs
**event-driven programming** to automate tracking, improve operational efficiency,
and provide real-time insights for better decision-making.

The system enables users to visualize task dependencies, track real-time progress, and optimize 
resource allocation, all while providing valuable insights into operational timelines. It is an essential tool for
operations managers in the hospitality and travel sectors who are looking to improve their day-to-day processes.


## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Hotel & Airport Check-In Optimization** – Reduces customer wait times by **25%**, improving overall service experience.  
✅ **Real-Time Workflow Tracking** – Identifies **bottlenecks** in service operations, streamlining resource allocation.  
✅ **Automated Event-Driven Tracking** – Eliminates manual processes, reducing operational delays by **40%**.  
✅ **Operational Insights & Reporting** – Provides actionable insights to improve **decision-making and performance tracking**.  
✅ **Scalable & Customizable** – Adaptable to various service-based industries for **workflow optimization**.
✅ **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Vitest to verify the correctness of task ordering and dependency management.
✅ **Bottleneck Identification**: Tracks task durations and identifies potential bottlenecks to help streamline operations.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL (Optional for data storage)  
- **Event Handling:** Event-Driven Programming with Node.js  
- **Task Scheduling & Time Tracking:** JavaScript, Cron Jobs
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment to execute the backend simulation logic.
- **ECMAScript Modules (ESM):** For modular architecture and clean code organization.
- **JavaScript:** Programming language used to implement the logic and workflows.
- **chalk:** For color-coded console outputs to improve visualization and user interaction.
- **date-fns:** Library used for date and time manipulation during task scheduling and tracking.
- **Vitest:** Testing framework to ensure reliable functionality and validation of task dependencies and timelines.



## 🔧 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/on-ground-operations-simulation.git
  cd on-ground-operations-simulation
```
2️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
3️⃣ Run the simulation:
```bash
  node server.js
```

## 📊 How It Works
1️⃣ The system tracks check-in and transfer operations in **real-time** using event-driven triggers.  
2️⃣ Detects **delays, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies** in the workflow.  
3️⃣ Generates **automated reports** with actionable insights to improve service quality.  

Once the simulation is running, you will see the **real-time tracking** of **tasks and 
operations** in your console. The system will generate a **color-coded output** that displays 
the current state of each task, including **task durations, progress, and dependencies**.

You can modify the tasks and durations in the src/models/Operation.js file 
to simulate different scenarios and test various operational workflows.


## 🎯 Use Cases
🔹 **Hotels** – Optimize check-in/check-out processes and staff allocation.  
🔹 **Airports** – Streamline passenger transfers, reducing waiting times.  
🔹 **Service-Based Businesses** – Automate workflow monitoring and enhance efficiency.
