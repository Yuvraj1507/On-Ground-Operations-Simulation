On-Ground Operations Simulation

Overview
The On-Ground Operations Simulation is a Node.js-based system designed to model and optimize the 
on-ground operations involved in the hospitality and travel industry. This project simulates complex workflows 
such as hotel check-ins and airport transfers to improve efficiency, minimize delays, and enhance customer satisfaction.

The system enables users to visualize task dependencies, track real-time progress, and optimize 
resource allocation, all while providing valuable insights into operational timelines. It is an essential tool for
operations managers in the hospitality and travel sectors who are looking to improve their day-to-day processes.

Key Features
~ Task Dependency Management: Tasks are linked by dependencies to ensure they are executed in the correct order and prevent delays.
~ Real-Time Progress Tracking: Monitors the progress of each task and provides an up-to-date overview of operations.
~ Time Simulation: Accurate simulation of task durations and operational timelines, including the calculation of total operation time.
~ Process Visualization: Color-coded console output and detailed timeline displays to aid in understanding operational workflows.
~ Bottleneck Identification: Tracks task durations and identifies potential bottlenecks to help streamline operations.
~ Resource Optimization: Efficient scheduling and resource allocation to improve operational efficiency and reduce delays.
~ Unit Testing: Comprehensive testing with Vitest to verify the correctness of task ordering and dependency management.

Simulation Scenarios
~ Hotel Group Check-In Process
Simulates the workflow for handling group check-ins, including tasks like group arrival, document 
collection, room allocation, key card preparation, and luggage handling.

Airport Transfer Operation
~ Simulates the process of transferring passengers from the airport to the hotel, including flight 
landing procedures, luggage collection, and transport logistics.

Technologies Used
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment to execute the backend simulation logic.
* ECMAScript Modules (ESM): For modular architecture and clean code organization.
* JavaScript: Programming language used to implement the logic and workflows.
* chalk: For color-coded console outputs to improve visualization and user interaction.
* date-fns: Library used for date and time manipulation during task scheduling and tracking.
* Vitest: Testing framework to ensure reliable functionality and validation of task dependencies and timelines.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Yuvraj1507/On-Ground-Operations-Simulation.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd On-Ground-Operations-Simulation

Install the dependencies:
npm install

Run the simulation:
node src/index.js

Usage
Once the simulation is running, you will see the real-time tracking of tasks and 
operations in your console. The system will generate a color-coded output that displays 
the current state of each task, including task durations, progress, and dependencies.

You can modify the tasks and durations in the src/models/Operation.js file 
to simulate different scenarios and test various operational workflows.
